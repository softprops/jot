    jot-cat               or (cat in SomeConfig)            # Lists your jottings
    jot-file              or (jotFile in SomeConfig)        # File containing jottings
    target(for jot)       or (target in (SomeConfig, jot))  # Directory containing jot-file

(*) subject to change in the future. Some key interface combinations of `jot-x(for jot)` were kind of annoying so some keys are not
scoped to jot. This may change in the future
